# 🚀 Character/Word/Sentence Counter

A very direct character/word/sentence counter done with react and typescript. No external libraries, just basic logic and usage of states and other variables to achieve the desired result.

## 🧠 Overview

This is a project from the website "FrontEnd Mentor". The challenge was to create a character counter initially, but then I realized it also needed a word and a sentence counter. 
I wanted to pick this project up from other options because I had already done an extremely simple character counter with react and TSX, but I wanted to expand on the idea and have a better-looking, more professional design to it.
